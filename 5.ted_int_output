what i want to talk about is , as background , is the idea that cars are art .
this is actually quite meaningful to me , because car designers tend to be a little bit low on the totem pole -- we do n't do coffee table books with just one lamp inside of it -- and cars are thought so much as a product that it 's a little bit difficult to get into the aesthetic side under the same sort of terminology that one would discuss art .
and so cars , as art , brings it into an emotional plane -- if you accept that -- that you have to deal with on the same level you would with art with a capital a.
now at this point you 're going to see a picture of michelangelo .
